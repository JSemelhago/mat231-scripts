# mat231-scripts

MATLAB and Python scripts used in MAT231: Modelling with Differential Equations

### MATLAB Code

A collection of multiple MATLAB scripts to help demystify differential equations. Descriptions of each file can be found in a comment at the top of each script.

### Projects

`SEIR_model` contains code for a MATLAB applet to solve a system of ODEs in the context of an SEIR model using `ode45`. It also contains the corresponding code for that and the Python code for solving it using Euler's method.

`SupplyChain_model` contains code that runs simulations to generate an aggregate representing the supply chain for a small store. It utilizes a Poisson distribution.

Output figures for both these projects can be found in their respective folders.
